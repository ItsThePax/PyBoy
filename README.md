# PyBoy
Gameboy emulator in python.

A fun project to work on in my free time, still far from finished.  I'm using this to teach myself how to code, hence weird naming schemes and formatting.

Requires Pygame 1.9.2, Python 2.7

Current implementation is slow, is being used for prototyping.

Current status as of 26JUL2016:

Display:
    background:
        - fully functional
    sprites:
        -8*8 sprite mode works
        -16*8 mode does not
        
Memory controllers:
    -no memory controller cartrages working
    -mc3 cartrage rom and ram page changes work, ram saving not yet worked on
    
CPU instructions:
    -All instructions implemented, still bugs though
    
Sound:
    -not implemented yet
    
Controls:
    -unresponsive but functional
